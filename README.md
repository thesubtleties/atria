# Atria - Event Management & Networking Platform

Atria is a comprehensive event management platform that enables organizers to create and manage events, sessions, and facilitate networking among attendees.

- Redux for global state management
- RTK Query for API data fetching and caching

## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL (recommended for production)
- Redis (for Socket.IO)

### Setup with Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd atria

# Create .env file from example
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your configurations

# Start the application with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# The application will be available at:
# - Backend: http://localhost:5000
# - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
```

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

#### Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend/atria

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your configurations

# Initialize the database
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade

# Seed the database (optional)
python -m seeders.seed_db

# Run the development server
flask run
```

#### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api" > .env.local

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

## üìã API Documentation

API documentation is available at `/new-swagger` when the backend server is running (http://localhost:5000/new-swagger).
