## Why Choose Atria?

### **Event-Focused, Not Platform-Focused**

Unlike complex enterprise tools that require months of training, Atria is laser-focused on one thing: **your event**. Once you enter an event, you get a completely event-centric view - no other events distracting you, no cluttered sidebars of unrelated features. No marketing email tools, no CRM bloat, no learning curve. Just powerful event and networking features that work immediately.

### **Open Source & True Data Ownership**

- **No Black Box** - Complete transparency into what happens with your data and how the platform works
- **Real Data Ownership** - Your data stays yours, export or migrate anytime without vendor lock-in
- **Pay What Makes Sense** - Use free self-hosted version or pay for hosted convenience - your choice
- **No Surprise Pricing** - Open source means you're never held hostage by sudden price increases
- **Build What You Need** - Add custom features or modify existing ones to fit your exact requirements
- **Internal Communities** - Create private, internal event networks for your organization's ongoing engagement
